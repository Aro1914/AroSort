# EmSort
The fastest whole number sorting algorithm!

## The Algorithm
  EmSort is a whole number sorting algorithm based on hash tables, the fact that every hash key must be unique and the ability for hash tables to store the occurence count of a hash key in its paired value.
  It takes advantage of the nature of objects and the way they are arranged in memory. With languages like JavaScript automatically arranging its keys and Python's ability to sort keys using the sorted(Object.keys()) funtion, this algorithm takes that into account and uses it to place each number in its ordered position in ascending order.
  
## Note
This algorithm works best with multiple recurring numbers; eliminating the duplicates but storing their occurrence count and repositioning them in an ordered form. Hence it cuts down on the time it would take complete the sorting as opposed to checking out the order of every single pair in the input array.
